# User Stories & Technologies used #


## SongBird is a MERN--'MongoDB-Express-React-Node.js' stack built app for musicians and music lovers together. Users come on to SongBird to share their music creations. Once an account is registered and signed in, users can access their profile pages and have access to the music in our app, they can also create a playlist by adding new music using a url to the audio file. Once uploaded, user can then play their audio file on our audio player. The music data can be updated as well and unwanted music can be deleted off the playlist and their profile page. ##

## Challenges ##
#### One of my biggest challenges was getting the media to play after upload as a file, I ended up fixing the issue by using a url to the audio file and using it as the audio source in the song display file. ####

## Upcoming Features ##


#### Something I want to be able to implement that I am going to keep working at is being able to upload a file directly from my machine to my app and have it play from my app that way. I also want to implement one to many relationships, in which users  can have multiple playlists. ####
